## üëã Hi, I'm Harjas!
I'm an Electronics and AI Engineering student with a passion for solving real-world problems through code. My interests span across AI/ML, computer vision, backend development, and data-driven applications. I enjoy building smart systems that bridge the gap between technology and impact‚Äîwhether it's automating workflows, analyzing patterns, or enhancing user experiences.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech I enjoy working with:
Python, FastAPI, SQL, Node.js, YOLO, OpenCV, LLMs, and more.

Outside the world of code, I‚Äôm a photographer, traveler, and most importantlty a cat love üêà. Whether it‚Äôs capturing concerts, wildlife, or spontaneous road trips, I‚Äôm always looking for new ways to combine creativity and tech, and create something impactful at the end of the day.

Let‚Äôs collaborate and create something meaningful!
